In python, scope means the domain that a variable can be used. In total, there are five kinds of scope in python:
- **local scope**, it means the variable is only defined in a function
- **enclosed scope**, it means the variable is defined outside the inner function, but inside the outer function
- **global scope**, it means the variable is defined through out the program
- **built-in scope**, it means some variables are set by some python libraries by default. 
- **comprehension scope**, it is a special scope where variables are only valid inside the comprehension. 
For example, 
```python
import math

var1 = "global"
def func1():
	var1 = "enclosed"
	def func2():
		var1 = "local"
		return var1
	var1 += func2()
	return var1

res = func1()
print(var1,res,math.pi) # math.pi is a built-in variable
```
the output is `"global" "enclosedlocal" 3.141592653589793`

# Why defined such scopes in python?

Because scopes **restrict and limit the effective range of variables**, avoiding possible name conflicts. 
Normally, we only want to use local variables locally, and try to avoid changing global settings. Thus it is necessary to set boundaries between local functions and global environment. 
As you can see in the example, I mentioned `var1` for many times, each time it was assigned with a different value, and had different tasks. If there is no limit of scopes, the whole code will went to a mess. 

# Rules of Scope

When program is executing, python finds what your variable name refers to in a specific order according to the scopes. It follows the [[LEGB rule]], search the local scope first, if not exist, then expand to enclosed, global, built-in. In fact, because of the [[Python files execution]] will detect and distribute whether a variable is or is not a local variable, and label it, this rule is seperated:
- for those were labeled as local variables, they will be only treated as local variable. 
- for those were labeled as non-local variables, they will not be treated as local variable. But the execution program still start to find these variable at local scope
**If and only if you assigned a variable locally, no matter whether this name is used outside the local scope, it will be treated as local variable in this functions**. 
For example: 
```python
var1 = 10
def func1():
	print(var1)
	var1 = 20 # var1 is defined as a local variable
	print(var1)
	return var1 + 1
res = func1()
print(res,func1())
```
the result is 
```python
UnboundLocalError: cannot access local variable 'var1' where it is not associated with a value
```
`
Yes, although you just attempt to read global variable var1 ahead of the assignment, the program won't print the value of global var1, instead, rise an UnboundLocalError . That is because early in the first compiling, var1 is labeled as local variable in func1() because the assignment sentence var1 = 20 regardless of its local position. So, when really execute, error comes before the printing output.
To fix it, you must declare that var1 is a global variable:
```python
var1 = 10
def func1():
	global var1
	print(var1)
	var1 = 20 # var1 is defined as a local variable
	print(var1)
	return var1 + 1
res = func1()
print(res,func1())
```
Then the correct output is:
```python
10
20
20
20
21 21
```

If you want to change global variables locally, or enclosed variables locally, you need to announce those variables with `global` or `nonlocal` respectively, like:  
```python
var1 = 100
def func1():
	global var1
	var1 += 1
	var2 = var1 * 2
	def func2():
		nonlocal var2
		var2 += 3
		return var2
	var2 += 1
	return (var1,var2,func2())

ans = func1()
var1 += 1
print(var1, ans, func1())
```
the output is `102 (101,203,206) (103,207,210)` . It may be a little complex, let's analyse together:
- steps: 
	- first I assigned global variable var1 to 100. At this time, a global [[namespace]] is also created:  var1 -> object(100) [global]
	- then I defined a function, so a function object is also created: func1->function(func1()). All the steps inside function is inside the object func1()[global]
	- I assigned `ans` with the value of func1, so the program will go through func1
	- var1 is announced as a global variable, so I can modify it locally
	- var1 is add by 1, now var1 -> object(101) [global]
	- local variable in func1() is created, and i assigned it value as 2 times value of var1, so a new namespace was created: var2 -> object(202) [local in func1()]
	- then I defined func2() inside func1, so func2 -> function(func2())[local in func1()] created, func2 is son of func1()
	- var2 is increased by 1, now var2 -> object(203) [local in func1()]
	- time to return a tuple. first two value were assigned as var1, var2, like func1_return_value->(101, 203, ?), ? represent func2_return_value.
	- dive into func2, I first declared var2 as a nonlocal variable, so var2 is an enclosed variable with respect to func2()
	- var2 increased by 3, then var2 -> object(206) [local in func1()]
	- func2_return_value -> 206, so func1_return_value->(101, 203, 206)
	- so ans->(101, 203, 206)
	- var1 is increased by 1, now var1 -> object(102) [global]
	- then I print the value of var1, ans, and also execute func1() again to get the third value. currently, the output is: 102 (101,203,206) ___ 
	- again, this time func1_return_value->(103, 206, 210).remember var2 is local in var1, it is a property of var1, so it will remain its value, and being modified each time you call var1. 
	- so the final out put is: 102 (101,203,206) (103, 206, 210)

So each time you want to distinguish what scope the variable in, check if there is an assignment locally. If not, then gradually expanded to outside.

# Special Case

A special case is the comprehension scope, **variable in comprehension only valid in comprehension**. once the comprehension finished, this variable vanished. Like:
```python
i = 100
def my_func():
    [i for i in range(5)]
    return i

print(my_func())
```
The result is `100`
In contrast, this situation is different: 
```python
i = 100
def my_func():
	x = []
    for i in range(5):
	    x.append(i)
    return i

print(my_func())
```
This time the result is `4`, because the for loop create a local variable i inside `my_func()`. Since there is not a loop scope, the `i`is really local through out `my_func()`, no matter inside or outside the for loop. So at last, `i`will point to 4.This `i` is labeled as *local variable* initially, so it is nothing to do with the global `i`.
